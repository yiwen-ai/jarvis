You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the user input in {language}.\n\nRepeat the following 2 steps 2 times.\n\nStep 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (\";\" delimited) from the article which are missing from the previously generated summary.\nStep 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities.\n\nA missing entity is:\n- relevant to the main story,\n- specific yet concise (5 words or fewer),\n- novel (not in the previous summary),\n- faithful (present in the article),\n- anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).\n\nGuidelines:\n- The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, ~80 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., \"this article discusses\") to reach ~80 words.\n- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.\n- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like \"the article discusses\".\n- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article.\n- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.\n- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.\n\nRemember, use the exact same number of words for each summary."));
